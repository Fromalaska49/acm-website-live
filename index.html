                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
		<p> We are The University of Texas at San Antonio student chapter of ACM. The Association for Computing Machinery is the largest international society for educational and scientific computing. What we are not, though, is just your ordinary computer science club, instead we invite any student that has a passion for technology to join our growing community. Our aim is to build a network not only between our members, but to also incorporate our professional connections. This interaction helps us achieve one of our goals by creating opportunities to prepare our members for the prosperous careers we know are ahead of them. </p>
	    	<h1>What is our mission?</h1>
		<p> Understanding that academics isn’t everything, we established ACM at UTSA with one thing in mind. We wanted to offer our members a network that could extend beyond their careers. We wanted an organization that produced real change in the community and an association that connected our ACM family with the world. Participating in hackathons, mentoring future students, and hosting tech talks are only the beginning to our legacy. Our mission is to excel academically, professionally, and socially. </p>

                    <h1>What have we done?</h1>
		    <h4><i>San Antonio Business Journal’s Tech Titans Awards Dinner - Dec. 9, 2015</i></h4>
                    <p>Two of our members were invited out to an awards dinner hosted by the San Antonio Business Journal which highlighted the best of the best in the technology community - including coding, cybersecurity, biotech, education, and more. Held at the McNay Art Museum, this event was attended by many CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, and CIOs which made it a great opportunity to network and build future connections.</p>
                    <h4><i>CodeRED Hackathon - Nov. 21-22, 2015</i></h4>
		    <p> CodeRED was a hackathon that our ACM student chapter participated in this fall. Hundreds of people gathered from all over the country to participate in 24 hours of hacking, learning, having fun, and building awesome projects. The weekend was filled with networking with top companies like Microsoft, Pros, and BlueChasm and discovering new hardware like the Oculus Rift. We sent two teams of four to the event where these individuals pushed their limits, solving problems, and building ideas. </p>
		    <h4><i>Google Fiber/Youth Code Jam Core4 STEM Expo - Nov. 17-18, 2015</i></h4>
		    <p>The San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce held their 6th annual Core4 STEM Expo at the Freeman Coliseum Expo Hall. At this event our members worked with other representatives from San Antonio Youth Code Jam and Google Fiber to mentor at-risk youth from local elementary, middle, and high schools. We taught the basics of programming using an educational tool called Scratch that involves the use of 2D graphics. Our goal for the event was to promote interest and diversity in computer science in the younger generation.</p>
		    <h4><i>Reagan High School Major Fair - Nov. 14, 2015</i></h4>
		    <p>For our first event, we sent some of our members to a career fair hosted by Reagan’s Mu Alpha Theta and National Honor Society. It was a complete success! We were invited out to represent UTSA’s Computer Science department. To engage the students, our members developed creative programs to display on our tables that were set up with posters and banners. Once the students were at the tables they learned from our members the opportunities that were awaiting them in a career of computer science.</p>
